# Reliability and validity of brain-gastric phase synchronization

Python implementation of the analysis from Levakov et al. 2023 paper, "Reliability and validity of brain-gastric phase 
synchronization".

## Getting started
First make sure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.7+
- FSL
- Docker
- Python packages: numpy, scipy, nibabel, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nilearn, fslpy, mne-python, bioread, nipype

Prepare the folder structure specified here under [Expected folder structure](#expected-folder-structure).
Copy the data from [link](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21952910.v1) to the corresponding folders in the project folder.
Copy the code from this repository to corresponding folders in the project folder.
Finally, run the main script `main_voxel_based.py` from the project folder.

## Scripts description:
* `main_voxel_based.py` - screens the subjects and runs list, run all the relevant scripts on all of them, then runs the second level analysis.

* Gastric initial preprocessing:
  * `egg_analysis/preprocess_gastric.py` - Preprocessing the EGG data

* Brain initial preprocessing:
  * `brain_analysis/run_fmriprep.py` - Running fMRIprep using Docker SDK
  * `brain_analysis/fmriprep_cleaning.py` - Confound regression
  * `ppu_analysis/add_cardiac_confound.py` - Adds cardiac confound to fmriprep confounds file based on niphlem RETROICOR method
  * `brain_analysis/brain_preprocessing.py`- additional preprocessing steps - spatial smooting + bandpass filtering 

* Assessing gastric-brain synchrony:
  * `synchrony_analysis/signal_slicing.py` - slicing the EGG signal according to the fMRI
  * `synchrony_analysis/voxel_based_analysis.py` - subject-level analysis of gastric-brain coupling
  * `synchrony_analysis/voxel_based_second_level.py` - second level analysis of gastric-brain coupling

* Additional important scripts:
  * `config.py` - defines global variables that are shared across analysis scripts, mainly preprocessing options.
  * `dataframes/brain_meta_data.csv` - a table listing all runs with relevant meta-data, quality control measures and manual configurations if exist (dominant channel, etc.).
  * `gastric_utils.py` - EGG processing related functions
  * `spect_utils.py` - spectrogram related analysis functions
  * `egg_confounds_sync.py` - contains the core functions used to calculate the synchronization between EGG signals and fMRI confounds (particularly head motion parameters) as presented in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figures 6-10. The code includes functions for Phase Locking Value (PLV) calculation, bandpass filtering around the gastric frequency, and confound processing. **Important Note**: This code was reconstructed from multiple source files approximately 3 years after the original analysis. While efforts were made to ensure accuracy, there might be minor discrepancies from the exact implementation used in the paper. Users may need to adapt the code to their specific data structure and requirements.

## Expected folder structure:

Folder structure inside [main_project_path]:

    |   |   |-- sub-LA
    |   |   |-- sub-...
    |-- fmriprep
    |   |-- out
    |   |-- tmp

    |   |-- ppu_analysis
    |-- plots
    |   |-- brain_gast
    |-- derivatives
    |   |-- brain_gast
* BIDS_data - contains the raw data in BIDS format
* fmriprep - contains the fmriprep outputs and temporary files
* physio - contains the electrogastrogram + oximeter data
* code - contains the analysis scripts
* plots - contains the plots generated by the analysis scripts (mainly for quality control)
* derivatives - contains the analysis outputs and intermediate files
